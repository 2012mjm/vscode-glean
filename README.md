# export-to-file README

The extention allows you to extract select text into a new or existing file.
For example, this is super useful during refactoring of your code - just select the code you would like to extract and choose the destination

## Features

Select text and use VSCode's code suggestion (aka "Lightbulb") to extract the text.
